<span class='releaseDate'>(August 19, 2005<span class='releaseTime'> 2:28am</span>)</span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Green, red and grey (along with the good 'ol blue) UI color selections.</li>
  <li>Now collapses horizontally as well as vertically.</li>
  <li>Individual widget instances remember their respective language settings, sizes and colors upon restart, and clean up the preference file when they're closed.</li>
  <li>The update check is now only performed once upon loading, then no more often than once a day.  You can opt-out of update checking altogether if you choose.</li>
  <li>When you scroll down in an article, then open a new article or go back in the history, the widget will remember where you were scrolled to, so if you return to the article it'll be where you left off.</li>
  <li>Localization compatible.  (If you are willing to help out the project by translating a few strings of text into another language, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks to those of you who have already helped out!)</li>
  <li>Deutsch localization by Christian Wilke</li>
  <li>Español localization by Christian Wilke</li>
  <li>Français localization by Floréal Molina</li>
  <li>Italiano localization by Marco Piccardo</li>
  <li>Another new icon, courtesy of Chad W. again. Thanks Chad.</li>
  <li>The 'cancel loading' behavior (click the progress indicator) has been fixed, I think.  It was pretty flakey when you were 'back' in the history a couple articles, clicked a link, then cancelled the loading.  A hover graphic has been added.</li>
  <li>A couple scrolling-related bugfixes.  Before, if you opened an article too short to fill the entire widget, and pressed the up/down arrows, or scrolled with the mousewheel, the content would jump from the top to the bottom of the viewing area.  Also, if you scrolled to the bottom of a large article, then opened a small article, sometimes the small article would be displayed 'offscreen' until scrolling up.</li>
  <li>The stretch animation has been smoothed out.</li>
  <li>Other small bugfixes that have slipped my mind.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.8.7.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.8.7', 'Change Log']);">0.8.7</a></span>
<span class='releaseDate'>(June  6, 2005<span class='releaseTime'> 3:16pm</span>)</span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Clicking the progress indicator cancels the article loading. Nice 'X' hover graphic forthcoming.</li>
  <li>Pressing Command-U will copy the URL of the currently showing article. This doesn't work properly with unicode characters yet.</li>
  <li>Table of Contents items don't appear as links anymore, because they didn't work anyway.</li>
  <li>Various bugfixes.</li>
  <li>This is a minor update, just to fulfill a couple specific requests. I axed the pesky 'beta' insignia; I don't think it needs it anymore.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.8.6.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.8.6', 'Change Log']);">0.8.6b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Fixed random article behavior, so you can use the random button more than once again.</li>
  <li>Window REALLY doesn't collapse on itself while resizing. Removed the temporary hack that sort of fixed the problem. Thanks to Michael Y. for this.</li>
  <li>Stripped out link titles so tooltips no longer show when the Dashboard is hidden. This is just a partial temporary work-around for Apple's bug, I have a better idea for fixing the problem.</li>
  <li>No longer writes a bunch of garbage to the Console.</li>
  <li>Works in Safari.</li>
  <li>Version checking should actually work now.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.8.5.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.8.5', 'Change Log']);">0.8.5b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Proxy server compatibility is back.</li>
  <li>Unicode characters in Swedish and a couple other languages that weren't working should work now.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.8.4.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.8.4', 'Change Log']);">0.8.4b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Progress indicator.</li>
  <li>Rudimentary collapsibility. It doesn't shrink into a nice bar like the Dictionary widget yet, but it will someday.</li>
  <li>Version number added to the back. Clicking it will open this page in your browser.</li>
  <li>Slightly updated graphics: Wikipedia button on front now matches the Wikipedia logo, replaced '?' (random page) button, replaced Wikipedia logo on back with a better image.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.8.3.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.8.3', 'Change Log']);">0.8.3b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Fixed case-sensitivity of certain search terms.</li>
  <li>Added an 'Empty Cache' button on the back to delete all cached pages.</li>
  <li>When resizing only vertically, the bottom of the widget will no longer collapse in on itself. The method I'm using isn't the best, but it'll work for now.</li>
  <li>Automatic version checking. When there's a newer version available, 'update available' will show up in the bottom left corner of the widget. Clicking that message will bring you to this page so you can download (or not download) the latest release.</li>
  <li>Slightly improved external link and 'open in browser' handling. A handful of unicode characters now work, the rest still don't.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'>0.8.2b</span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Fixed articles with an ampersand (&) in the name.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'>0.8.1b</span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Fixed unicode searches and 'x' button behavior. Both were broken in 0.8.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'>0.8b</span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Scroll-wheel and track-pad scrollable. This probably only works with the 10.4.1 update. You better get on that.</li>
  <li>Keyboard scrollable. Up and down arrow keys scroll a couple lines. Page up/page down and the space bar scroll down one view's worth. Home/End jump to the top and bottom of the article. You must click somewhere in the content area for this to work.</li>
  <li>Back and forward history buttons with short-term (or long-term if you choose) page caching. You can set the cache life in minutes on the back; set it to 0 if you always want to grab the latest page from wikipedia. Cache life defaults to 5 minutes. Cached pages are stored in ~/Library/Caches/WikipediaWidget/</li>
  <li>Articles with umlauts and other fun characters in the names should work properly now, hopefully in all languages.</li>
  <li>Math formulas now display correctly.</li>
  <li>Language code and cache lifetime are stored in preferences, so you shouldn't have to reset them every time you reopen the widget.</li>
  <li>The widget no longer freezes while pulling up an article. There isn't a progress indicator yet, but there will be soon. I'm working on it.</li>
  <li>New icon, courtesy of Chad W. Thanks Chad.</li>
  <li>A handful of new bugs, I'm sure.  This was a pretty substantial rewrite. It uses a different system for pulling the pages from wikipedia, so it might choke on certain articles.</li>
  <li>The javascript is now licensed with a modified version of the MIT license, officially granting everyone to do (almost) whatever they want with it.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.7.2.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.7.2', 'Change Log']);">0.7.2b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>The external links work again. I had changed a bit of code for testing (which broke the externals), and forgot to change it back before uploading the new copy. Unfortunately, about 11,000 people have that copy, the vast majority of whom will never see this page or this update.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.7.1.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.7.1', 'Change Log']);">0.7.1b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Text is now selectable, meaning you can copy portions of the wikipedia article and paste them in the destination of your choosing. Text selection is limited to the portion of the article currently showing, so stretch it out if you want to copy a lot. Dragging a selection past the bounds of the widget won't cause it to scroll automatically. Side effect: You can no longer drag the widget by the content area, of course.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.7.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.7.0', 'Change Log']);">0.7b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>External links and edit links now open in your default browser. Links with unicode characters in them will fail to open in the browser.</li>
  <li>Image links now work. The widget will pull the Image: page in, with a larger copy of the picture.</li>
  <li>Certain internal wiki links that didn't work before should work now.</li>
  <li>Search terms with unicode characters should work now.</li>
  <li>Language names for every wikipedia with over 1,000 articles should show in the search bar when the corresponding code is entered in the back.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.6.1.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.6.1', 'Change Log']);">0.6.1b</a></span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Tables and other "big" content don't overflow past the scroll bar anymore.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'>0.6b</span>
<ul class='releaseBody'>
  <li>Article names you type in aren't nearly as picky anymore, title caps aren't required like they were for some search terms.</li>
  <li>When an article by that exact name couldn't be found, it'll pull in the search results for the term you submitted. This is limited to the first page of results, however, because I haven't put any work into getting the other links working yet. It should be good enough for most purposes though.</li>
  <li>Some articles were being displayed incorrectly. Most of these should be fixed now.</li>
  <li>Language names are now shown in the search box in full unicode goodness for every language with over 10,000 wikipedia articles.</li>
</ul>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.2.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.2', 'Change Log']);">0.2</a></span><br/>

<span class='releaseVersion'><a href="downloads/Wikipedia 0.1.zip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', '0.1', 'Change Log']);">0.1</a></span>
